			<h1>Phase 1: Planning</h1>
			<p>According to the requirements of CCT260 project 2, I first planned the general direction in my mind. The 5-page personal homepage includes a homepage, highlights, resume, contact, and process.</p>

			<h1>Phase 2: Prototyping</h1>
			<p>I planned to use Figma to make a simple prototype. I think this part takes more time because I have no idea or experience with the production of a personal web page. So, I looked at some templates and videos on Google and YouTube. Browsing through these works gave me so much inspiration that I whipped up a simple template in no time. It is worth mentioning that when prototyping, it is necessary to consider information architecture, design principles, and accessibility. I think a good framework and design can save me time in the later coding phase</p>

			<h1>Phase 3: Coding</h1>
			<p>During this semester, we learned a lot about HTML and CSS, especially division tags and some interactive effects in CSS files which impressed me deeply. First, I made a Home Page, combining the Lab examples shown by the professor in class and some ideas I saw on the Internet. Following the guidance in WCAG2.0 Accessibility, I focused on layout, visual presentation, usability and accessibility, and structure to ensure that my website has good accessibility. In addition, I added some interesting effects, such as navigation effects on the homepage. When the user puts the mouse on the picture, the picture will be enlarged and the text will have different effects. Contrast between text and background color is also important, so every text on my profile is clearly visible</p>
			<p>I added social media links in the lower left corner of the footer as well. When the user clicks on the corresponding social media link such as LinkedIn, GitHub will automatically jump to my social media homepage. On the "Highlights" page, I did my best to improve visuals and accessibility by changing the layout of text and images. It is worth noting that I have added corresponding remarks to each image code. Besides, I added the loop's video as a spotlight on the highlight page, and I think I did a good job in this part. I used PR to edit the video and added it to the page using the knowledge I learned in class.</p>
			<p>In the resume section, I noticed that Table was required to complete this page, but I was not familiar with the Table section, so it took me some time. Fortunately, I finally made it, but it's a bit crude. I hope I can improve this page in the future.</p>
			<p>In addition, I followed the requirements for other parts, such as the contact part, but most of them were based on the examples given in class.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Finally I finished my profile, I hope you like it!</p>
